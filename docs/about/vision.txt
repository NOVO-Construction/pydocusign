`pydocusign` is a Python client for `DocuSign`_ signature SAAS platform.

As `pydocusign` author, I basically needed Python bindings for DocuSign API,
but I did not find one either on
https://pypi.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=search&term=docusign or
https://www.docusign.com/developer-center/helper-libraries.
So initiating a new one looked like a fair start. I published it under BSD so
that it can be used, improved and maintained by a community.

So, **feel free to report issues, request features or refactoring!** See
:doc:`/contributing` for details.
